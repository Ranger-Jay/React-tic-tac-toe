# React-tic-tac-toe
practice with deploying react on gh-pages. In app, practiced with State and onClick.

to deploy this react app to github pages, I needed to add a home page, as well as a deploy, and redeploy script to the package.json file.

the main branch contains the base files.  the gh-pages branch contains the github pages deployment version of the app.

just run create-react-app to add all the node modules.

also need to make sure all the files and folders are in the root directory, to deply this locally
